Intel Image Classification Project

This project is an image classification system designed to categorize natural scene images from the Intel Image Classification dataset into six classes: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street. The system uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically extract features from images and provide accurate predictions. It also offers an interactive interface for real-time image classification.

Project Objective

The main goals of this project are:

Automate the classification of natural scene images.

Leverage CNNs to learn features directly from image data without manual feature engineering.

Provide a user-friendly interface for testing and visualizing predictions.

Maintain a clean and organized project structure suitable for collaboration and deployment.

Dataset

Source: Intel Image Classification dataset on Kaggle

Classes: 6 (Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, Street)

Dataset Structure: The dataset is split into training and testing directories, each containing subdirectories for each class.

Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size. Users need to download it separately from Kaggle.

Model and Methodology

The project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is well-suited for image classification tasks due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images. Key aspects of the model and workflow:

Feature extraction: Multiple convolutional layers extract important features from input images.

Pooling layers: Reduce dimensionality while retaining significant features.

Fully connected layers: Learn high-level representations for classification.

Regularization: Techniques such as dropout are applied to reduce overfitting.

Output layer: Uses softmax activation to classify images into six categories.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment through a Gradio interface for interactive predictions.

Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

app.py: Interactive application for uploading images and obtaining predictions.

code.ipynb: Notebook containing model exploration, training methodology, and evaluation (for reference).

.gitignore: Ensures large datasets and virtual environments are not included in the repository.

README.md: Detailed project documentation.

Dataset folders are intentionally excluded from the repository to keep it lightweight.

Features

Interactive prediction: Users can test the model on new images via a web-based interface.

Automatic feature learning: CNN automatically identifies important image features for classification.

Scalable: The model can be retrained or fine-tuned for other similar image classification tasks.

Lightweight repository: Large datasets and environments are ignored using .gitignore.

Usage Overview

Users can run the project locally and upload images to obtain predictions.

For meaningful predictions, the model should be trained on the full Intel dataset.

The system can be deployed locally or on cloud platforms for interactive access.

Notes

The project focuses on educational and demonstration purposes.

Performance depends on the quality and size of the dataset used for training.

Future improvements could include data augmentation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter optimization to improve accuracy.
