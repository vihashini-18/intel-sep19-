Intel Image Classification
Project Overview

This project is an image classification system designed to automatically categorize natural scene images into six classes: Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, and Street. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system learns to extract features from images and predict their corresponding classes with high accuracy. A user-friendly interface is also provided for real-time predictions.

Problem Statement

Manual categorization of images is time-consuming and prone to errors. Automating this process enables faster, consistent, and scalable classification, which can be applied in domains such as:

Environmental monitoring

Geographic image analysis

Automated photo organization

The main challenge lies in accurately distinguishing between visually similar classes like mountains vs glaciers or sea vs street.

Dataset

Source: Intel Image Classification dataset on Kaggle

Number of Classes: 6

Classes: Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, Street

Dataset Structure:

Training folder (seg_train) with subfolders for each class

Testing folder (seg_test) with subfolders for each class

Note: The dataset is not included in this repository due to size; it must be downloaded separately from Kaggle.

Methodology

The project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform classification:

Data Preprocessing: Images are resized and normalized to prepare for training.

Feature Extraction: Convolutional layers detect patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes.

Dimensionality Reduction: Pooling layers reduce feature map sizes while retaining essential information.

Classification: Fully connected layers learn higher-level representations, and the softmax layer outputs probabilities for each class.

Regularization: Techniques like dropout prevent overfitting, improving generalization on unseen images.

The workflow includes model training, validation, evaluation, and deployment via an interactive Gradio interface for live predictions.

Results

The CNN model achieves accurate predictions across the six classes.

Confidence scores are provided for each prediction, allowing users to evaluate model certainty.

Visual evaluation confirms that the model effectively distinguishes between different natural scene categories.

Features

Real-time Predictions: Upload images through an interactive interface to get instant results.

Automatic Feature Learning: CNN learns relevant features without manual intervention.

Scalable Architecture: The model can be fine-tuned for other image classification tasks.

Clean Repository: Large dataset folders and virtual environments are excluded using .gitignore.

Future Work

Data Augmentation: Improve model robustness by augmenting the dataset with rotations, flips, and color variations.

Transfer Learning: Use pre-trained models to achieve faster convergence and higher accuracy.

Hyperparameter Optimization: Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and network depth to enhance performance.

Deployment: Host the Gradio app on cloud platforms for broader access and real-time usage.
